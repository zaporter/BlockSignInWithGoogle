# BlockSignInWithGoogle

There are many ways to block this popup:

Here are some ways I found on the web:

1. [uBlockOrigin url filter](https://superuser.com/questions/1773208/how-can-i-block-the-sign-in-with-google-prompt-on-websites)
2. [uBlockOrigin element filter](https://superuser.com/questions/1495197/how-to-permanently-block-sign-in-with-google-suggestions-from-websites)
3. [StopTheMadness extension + a match on the div](https://underpassapp.com/news/2022-12-22.html)
4. [Google account config (doesn't work if you don't have a google account...)](https://www.lireo.com/quick-tip-how-to-turn-off-sign-in-with-google-on-websites/)
5. [This insane 5$/year extension that does what this script does](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/block-google-sign-in-prompt/)

But none of those do a great job syncing across all my devices. I just wanted a simple firefox extension that blocked this div from appearing.

Here it is! Add it to firefox today!

(This should also work on chromium but I haven't tried packaging it)
